# vsi_to_tif

This repository is designed to convert multiple image files with the `vsi` format to 
[OME-TIFF](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.3/ome-tiff/) at once using 
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable). The `vsi` image files generated 
using the [Olympus VS200 scanner](https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2019/nr01430.html) 
have limited compatibility with image processing tools. Converting individual `vsi` 
images using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) or 
[QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) has been a common solution with substantial effort and time, 
depending on the input load. 

Here, Iâ€™d like to propose a simple Snakemake pipeline that allows parallel 
conversion of multiple input `vsi` images at once. This approach uses 
[`bftools`](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v8.3.0/users/comlinetools/index.html), 
a collection of command-line tools provided by 
the [Bio-Formats](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v8.3.0/about/index.html) library.
Refer to the following documentation for more information about parameter setting:

- [`showinf`](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v8.3.0/users/comlinetools/display.html)
- [`bfconvert`](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v8.3.0/users/comlinetools/conversion.html)

## Package installation

Packages were installed using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager.
For more detailed information about packages and versions, refer to 
the `env.archived.yaml` file.

## Scripts

- `snakemake/Snakefile`: Running Snakemake pipeline to convert `vsi` to `tif`
- `snakemake/config/config.yaml`: Configuring Snakemake
- `snakemake/config/WRAPPER_SLURM`: Optionally enabling Snakemake to run on a cluster. 
The Snakemake profile is cluster-specific. The current wrapper is for the 
[Slurm cluster of NIH Biowulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/userguide.html). If you are new
to setting up your Snakemake profile, follow the instructions in 
*[Setting up Snakemake profile](#setting-up-snakemake-profile)*.
- `snakemake/config/sampletable.txt`: 
Specifying sample names and corresponding input image paths
- `snakemake/image_conversion.Rmd`: 
Wrapper script running `bftools` for image conversion

## Setting up Snakemake profile

This demonstration is for users of [NIH Biowulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/). If you are an NIH user, 
follow the one-time setup below. Otherwise, consult with your HPC staff.
If you don't use HPC, disregard the current section.

1. Clone the [snakemake_profile](https://github.com/NIH-HPC/snakemake_profile) GitHub repository

```bash
# Clone the repo for Snakemake<8
$ git clone https://github.com/NIH-HPC/snakemake_profile.git <path/to/snakemake_profile>

# Clone the repo for Snakemake>=8
$ git clone https://github.com/NIH-HPC/snakemake_profile.git <path/to/snakemake_profile_v8>
$ cd <path/to/snakemake_profile_v8>
# Change active branch to make it compatible with Snakemake>=8
$ git checkout snakemake8
```

2. Add the paths to your Snakemake profile to your bash configuration (`~/.bashrc`)

```bash
# Add env var for Snakemake<8
$ echo '$SNAKEMAKE_PROFILE=<path/to/snakemake_profile>' >> ~/.bashrc
# Add env var for Snakemake>=8
$ echo '$SNAKEMAKE_PROFILE_V8=<path/to/snakemake_profile_v8>' >> ~/.bashrc
```

3. Update your bash configuration

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
